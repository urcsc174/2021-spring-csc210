# Assignment 7: Legibility, Readability, and Typography

*Due: Friday, March 26, 2021*

NOTE: this is another *individual assignment* - you will work on this assignment by yourself and turn it in on Blackboard for your own grade.

**The goal** of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of the typography, specifically the choice and application of custom fonts on webpages.

**The purpose** of this assignment is to practice some of the technical skills that will be needed for Project 2.

NOTE: for this assignment you'll need to get back into working with HTML and CSS, and installing files on our production web server, UR Digital Scholar.

## Step 1: Choose an Assignment 2 Website

- Refer back to [our Assignment 2 websites listed on one of our shared Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rAZzYDRKwMR2A0Kp43eG-GwvD_hC88srLtbNwXHsvtM/edit#gid=0); use the links in Column H
- Pick one of the websites (which may include your own) that uses typefaces and fonts that you believe you can improve
  - Consider the CONTENT in the website! Read the words.  Get a feel for the *mood*, and if the design is good, consider the colors and layout.  Do they project a certain feeling that isn't reflected in the fonts?  If so, that might be a good choice for you to use here in Assignment 7
  - Is the website as legible and readable as possible?  Are there things you can do to improve the legibility and readability?

## Step 2: Get the Website and Prepare to Edit

- Once you've selected a website, back in the Google Sheet, use the link to its GitHub repository (Column I) to FORK the repo to your own GitHub account.
  - Make sure the new repository is set to PUBLIC
- Sync the new repo to your computer and prepare to edit
- Replace ALL the content in the README.md file
  - Set up the readme with your own information (Assignment info, your name, etc.)
  - Include a direct link to the Assignment 2 website on Digital Scholar that you're using
  - List the fonts being used in the old Assignment 2 website

## Step 3: Pick new Fonts and Explain Your Choices

- Based on the information from the lecture video (from Wednesday), choose a new set of well-paired fonts for the website
  - Your choices cannot be random.  Your choices must be explainable.
- Edit the README.md file to explain your font choices
  - You must never use words to the effect: *I think they look better*
  - Explain your font choices and where and how you plan to use them in the website using technical terms

Note: *after* you install the new fonts in the next step, you'll need to made decisions about how to improve the legibility and readability of the text after that, and explain your choices then too.

## Step 4: Install the New Fonts, Edit the CSS, and Explain Your Choices

- Edit the website and install the new fonts as you described in your readme file

Next, consider the legibility and readability of the website with the new fonts installed; refer to the **10 Principles for Readable Web** article and any other resources to help you improve it.

- Make changes to the the CSS (and HTML if required) to improve the legibility and readability of the website
  - Be careful to keep track of the changes you make!
- Edit the README.md file to explain your CSS edits
  - Do *not* just describe the edits you made (those can be seen in the CSS easily enough); you need to describe WHY you made the edits you did
  - Explain your CSS changes in the website using technical terms

## Step 5: Install the Updated Website and Turn It In

To get credit for your work:

- Sync your updated website (including the updated README.md file) to your new repository
- FTP the updated website to a folder on your UR Digital Scholar account in a folder named **assignment07**
-  In Blackboard, provide links to both your repo in GitHub and the Assignment 7 website on your UR Digital Scholar account
