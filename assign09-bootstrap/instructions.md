# Assignment 9: Bootstrap

*Due: Friday, April 16, 2021 (same day)*

**The goal** of this assignment is to work as a team to build a new website, styled completely by Bootstrap

**The purpose** of this assignment is to learn the basics of using a CSS Framework (like Bootstrap) while getting more experience working in a team using both Slack and GitHub to coordinate

Step 1: Create Teams
--------------------

*Five minutes*

1. Access [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) and scroll down to **Assignment 9**; **team up with one or two other students** 
   - People with CSS Framework experience identify themselves (goal: one per team)
   - People using a localhost and who are proficient with PHP Includes identify themselves (goal: create full teams of localhost users, else you can't use PHP Includes)
   - Note: for this assignment everyone is equal; no established roles; you will need to decide who does what as you go in real time
2. **Create a new, temporary, private Slack channel** and add the team as members
3. **Create a new GitHub repository** and setup the team as collaborators
   - *IMPORTANT: This assignment will require everyone use GitHub; everyone will have to do a relatively equal amount of work, as determined by the proper use of commits in the repository*
4. In [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0), **paste a link to the GitHub repo

Step 2: Add Content
--------------------

*Ten minutes*

Note: for the following steps (for the rest of this assignment) you need to coordinate with your team, who does what  (typically by using Slack), and then quickly and often use GitHub to:

- Write a Summary
- Commit to master
- Push origin

...quickly and often, while *Pulling* from the origin whenever your team members make their updates.

Remember: you need to resolve conflicts whenever they occur.

1. **Create a new, plain, empty HTML document** in the repo; everyone sync to local file system
   - Do not name the file *index*
2. Everyone work on the same document and **create placeholder content** ([lorem ipsum](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/79940998-15-funny-lorem-ipsum-generators-to-shake-up-your-design-mockups) and [FPO images](https://loremipsum.io/21-of-the-best-placeholder-image-generators/)); also note, when creating similar elements, you must use different amounts of placeholder content to simulate real content
   - A simple document outline with **one H1, and three H2s**
   - For the H2s add **three paragraphs** under each
   - **Embed small images** between the H2s and their following paragraphs
   - Create a fourth H2 followed by a short paragraph followed by **a data table** (at least 3x5 but more is better)
   - Under the data table, create another short paragraph followed by **an unordered list** (at least five items)
   - Create a fifth H2 followed by a short paragraph followed by **an HTML form** (action="#")
   - Within the HTML form create **three labels and input fields (various kinds) followed by a submit button**

Step 3: Install and Use Bootstrap
--------------------

*30 Minutes*

Note: for the following steps (and for the rest of this assignment) you'll need to [use the instructions on the Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

<hr>


1. Install Bootstrap on the webpage
2. Use the following Bootstrap features somewhere on the page (see the Bootstrap Docs for instructions)
   - a container
   - three "wells" in a row with some content side-by-side
   - style the table (at the very least, alternate striped rows)
   - style the list
   - style the HTML form
3. When done, indicate so on [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) by setting the background color of your GitHub repo link to green
