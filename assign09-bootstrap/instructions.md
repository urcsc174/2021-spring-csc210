# Assignment 9: Bootstrap

*Due: Friday, April 16, 2021 (same day)*

**The goal** of this assignment is to work as a team to build a new website, styled completely by Bootstrap

**The purpose** of this assignment is to learn the basics of using a CSS Framework (like Bootstrap) while getting more experience working in a team using both Slack and GitHub to coordinate

Step 1: Create Teams
--------------------

*Five minutes*

1. Access [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0); **team up with one or two other students** 
   - People with CSS Framework experience identify themselves (goal: one per team)
   - People using a localhost and who are proficient with PHP Includes identify themselves (goal: create full teams of localhost users, else you can't use PHP Includes)
   - Note: for this assignment everyone is equal; no established roles; you will need to decide who does what as you go in real time
2. **Create a new, temporary, private Slack channel** and add the team as members
3. **Create a new GitHub repository** and setup the team as collaborators
   - *IMPORTANT: This assignment will require everyone use GitHub; everyone will have to do a relatively equal amount of work, as determined by the proper use of commits in the repository*
4. In [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0), **paste a link to the GitHub repo**

Step 2: Add Content
--------------------

*Ten minutes*

Note: for the following steps (for the rest of this assignment) you need to coordinate with your team, who does what, and then quickly use GitHub to (1) write a summary, (2) Commit to Master, and (3) Sync

5. **Create a new, plain, empty HTML document** in the repo; everyone sync to local file system

6. Everyone work on the same document and **create placeholder content** (lorem ipsum and FPO images); when creating similar elements, you must use different amounts of placeholder content
   - A simple document outline with **one H1, and three H2s**
   - For the H2s add **three paragraphs** under each
   - **Embed small placeholder images** between the H2s and their following paragraphs
   - Create a fourth H2 followed by a short paragraph followed by **a data table**
   - Under the data table, create another short paragraph followed by **an unordered list**
   - Create a fifth H2 followed by a short paragraph followed by **an HTML form** (action="#")
   - Within the HTML form create **three labels and input fields followed by a submit button**

Step 3: Install and Use Bootstrap
--------------------

*30 Minutes*

7. Install Bootstrap on the webpage
   - [Instructions on the Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
8. Use the following Bootstrap features somewhere on the page
   - a container
   - three "wells" in a row with some content side-by-side
   - style the table (at the very least, alternate striped rows)
   - style the list
   - style the HTML form
9. When done, indicate so on the shared Google Sheet

GATHER MORE CONTENT (15 minutes)
--------------------
10. Using the shared Google Sheet, download three other completed webpages and add them to your repository

11. Normalize the webpages: make sure they all install Bootstrap the same way
   - if you're in a team of localhost users you might want to consider setting up a PHP Include for the HEAD element (and other redundant elements)
   - make sure all four webpages still display correctly

12. Add a Bootstrap navigation element to all the webpages so the user can navigate from page to page
   - Use a PHP Include if possible

BUILD A HOMEPAGE (10 minutes)
--------------------
13. Create a fifth webpage named index and stitch it into the navigation

14. On the index page, install a Jumbotron with four parts; one that links to each subpage

PUBLISH AND TURN IT IN (5 minutes)
--------------------
15. One team member: publish the five page website in a folder named assignment09 in UR Digital Scholar
16. Paste a link to the published website in the shared Google Sheet
15. EVERYONE (separately) go to Blackboard and make a submission for Assignment 9: Bootstrap, and in the Write section, add:
    - names of the other team members AND their GitHub names
    - a link to the GitHub repository
    - a link to the published website on UR Digital Scholar
