# Assignment 9: Bootstrap

*Due: Friday, April 16, 2021 (same day)*

**The goal** of this assignment is to work as a team to build a new website, styled completely by Bootstrap

**The purpose** of this assignment is to learn the basics of using a CSS Framework (like Bootstrap) while getting more experience working in a team using both Slack and GitHub to coordinate

Step 1: Create Teams
--------------------

*Five minutes*

1. Access [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) and scroll down to **Assignment 9**; **team up with one or two other students** 
   - People with CSS Framework experience identify themselves (goal: one per team)
   - People using a localhost and who are proficient with PHP Includes identify themselves (goal: create full teams of localhost users, else you can't use PHP Includes)
   - Note: for this assignment everyone is equal; no established roles; you will need to decide who does what as you go in real time
2. **Create a new, temporary, private Slack channel** and add the team as members
3. **Create a new GitHub repository** and setup the team as collaborators
   - *IMPORTANT: This assignment will require everyone use GitHub; everyone will have to do a relatively equal amount of work, as determined by the proper use of commits in the repository*
4. In [our shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0), **paste a link to the GitHub repo
