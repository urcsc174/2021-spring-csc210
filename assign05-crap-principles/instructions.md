# Assignment 5: CRAP Principles

*Due: Friday, March 12, 2021*

NOTE: this is another *individual assignment* - you will work on this assignment by yourself and turn it in on Blackboard for your own grade.

**The goal** of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of the four page design principles, C.R.A.P.

**The purpose** of this assignment is to identify improvements in a website(s) that you can implement later in Project 2

## Step 1: Find Webpage(s)

- **Everyone:** pick a webpage that you did *not* work on previously, from **any of the Assignment 3 websites**, that you want to use to demonstrate your understanding of the C.R.A.P. principles
  - You can link to the Assignment 3 websites from [our shared City-Teams Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0)
  - Note: if you need to pick two (or more?) webpages to do this assignment that's okay.

## Step 2: Define CRAP Improvements

- Create an markdown file named **assignment05.md**
  - Just like with Assignment 4, format the markdown document as you write, creating logical headings, paragraphs, lists, etc., and add the regular pieces of meta information like your name, the date, the name of the assignment ...typical college-level elements for any assignment you need to turn-in for a grade

- In the markdown document, write the following for EACH of the four CRAP principles:
  - The name and URL of the webpage you selected
  - A description of exactly where on the page one of the CRAP principles was done wrong or not well enough
  - A description of what should have been done differently

## Step 3: Turn-in the Markdown Document

To get credit for your work:

- In Blackboard, upload the **assignment05.md** file into the **Assignment 5: CRAP Principles** assignment
