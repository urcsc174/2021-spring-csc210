# Assignment 8: WordPress

*Due: Friday, April 9, 2021*

**The purpose** of this assignment is to become familiar with a particular CMS implementation, WordPress, so you begin to understand how CMSs work.

**The goal** of this assignment is to have an installed and customized WordPress website on your own UR Digital Scholar account that *could* be used to host your collegiate portfolio

- Note: your Assignment 8 WordPress website will be a *throw away* website (a "sandbox") where you can experiment and try out features ...mess things up.  
- Whatever you learn from Assignment 8 you can apply to another instance of WordPress that you can create whenever you want.

## Step 1: Install WordPress

Note: there are three ways to install WordPress 

- **WordPress.com** - a hosted (and limited) version of the CMS where all the *hard parts* are taken care of for you at the expense of features and flexibility (and some money); simply sign-up and the WordPress website will give you access to a fully installed instance of WordPress
- **WordPress.org** - the original WordPress that IT people and web developers (like you) can download and install on their own web server (like Digital Scholar) for free, giving them the most number of features and flexibility because all the code is open-source and editable
- **Auto-installed WordPress** - many hosted web providers, including Digital Scholar, provide *one-button installer* systems to make it simple to install the original WordPress system on their own web server &larr;Â THIS IS WHAT WE'LL USE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT
  - The one-button installer software is created by a company called "Installatron." Beware: the publishers of the "Installatron" try to entice you to purchase add-ons.  Avoid them.

- Login to your UR Digital Scholar account and proceed to the **Dashboard**
- Click the **WordPress** chicklet (top left)
- On the "Installatron" page, click the **install this application** button
- On the next page, under **Location**, enter a directory name: **assignment08**
- Scroll down to **Settings** and change the *Administrator Username* and *Administrator Password* to something (anything) that you'll remember
- Still under **Settings** change the *Website Title* to **DMS 290: Front-end Web Design** and the *Website Tagline* to **Assignment 8: WordPress**
- Leave all other settings as-is and click the **install** button
- After the install process completes, take note of the first two links; they point to the "front" of your WordPress website (the public-facing side), and the "backend" of your WordPress website, where you will login and and manage your website

The following steps assume you are familiar with basic WordPress concepts and how they work, or you're willing to figure them out yourself.  If not, be sure to attend the **live workshop on Friday, April 2 at 10:25 AM EDT**.

Take a look at both the front and backends of your WordPress website using the links from the previous step, and then...

## Step 2: Switch from a Blog to a Static Website

Assuming you don't want people to comment on your website, you need to change some of the settings of your WordPress website to convert it from a *blog* to a *static* Website

- In the *Dashboard* of your WordPress website, in the **Pages** area, create a new page and call it "Home"
  - Note: there's nothing magic about the name "Home" - you can call it anything you want
- Add some dummy content to your new Home page and then **Publish** it
- Go back to the *Dashboard* and then to the **Settings** area, and then into **Reading Settings**; there set the "static page" to your new Home page; **Save Changes**

Visit the front-facing (public-side) of your website to view your changes

## Step 3: Install a New Theme

- Back in the *Dashboard* of your new WordPress website, in the **Appearance** area, find a new **Theme** and then install and activate it
  - Do NOT use any of the pre-installed themes; you must find a new one in the WordPress catalog *or* get one from the web (preferably a free one) and then install and activate that one
  - Find a theme that you think might work well to turn your WordPress website into **a portfolio for your collegiate work**
  - Note: you can try a Theme, and if it doesn't work out, try another one!

Visit the front-facing (public-side) of your website to view your changes

- OPTIONAL: in the *Dashboard* of your WordPress website, in the **Plugins** area, find a new plugin that helps you design and build your portfolio

## Step 4: Add Content

The idea behind this assignment is to start thinking about using WordPress to build-out a portfolio website for yourself.  This particular website ("assignment08") is just a *"sandbox"* where you an experiment and try things out.  Whatever you learn here you can apply to another WordPress website later, for real.

- Start experimenting with content - add more pages (content) and work with your chosen Theme and plugin(s) to learn how they work.

There is no minimum amount of content you need to add to your WordPress website to pass this assignment, but obviously the more practice you can get in, the better.  Later, you'll build a bigger WordPress website with your team for Project 3.

## Step 5: Turn-in Your WordPress Website for Credit

To get credit for your work:

- In Blackboard, in the **Assignment 8: WordPress** assignment, paste a link to your WordPress website and submit it
