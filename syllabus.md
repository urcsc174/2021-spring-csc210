### Grade Distribution

| Activity                                                     | Weight of the final grade                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Homework Assignments**<br>There is extra work every week at the discretion of the instructor.  Each assignment counts equally toward the total of 30%.  There will be around 10 assignments depending on current changes in the web development industry. | **30%**<br>Each assignment will be worth about 3% of the overall grade |
| **Projects**<br>There are five projects during the semester, each of which will be completed by a team of students.  Everyone on the team initially gets the same grade, followed by a balancing process that rewards students who completed more work than required, while penalizing students who were unable to complete their portion of the work. | **50%**<br/>Project 1: 10%<br>Project 2: 10%<br>Project 3: 10%<br>Project 4: 10%<br>Project 5: 10% |
| **Participation**<br>There are several required activities that students must perform for the benefit of the class which include viewing recorded videos, and to the degree possible, participating in real-time discussions, online.  The total of all activities will count equally toward the total of 20% | **20%**<br>Each participation activity will be worth about 1.0% of the overall grade |

*Note: there are no exams in DMS 290; the results of the projects will be the primary assessment tool to determine the student's proficiency with the course material*

### Participation

The design of this course follows a "flipped" structure that requires students to learn basic concepts as assigned *outside the classroom*, and participate in workshops and group activities during the classroom sessions. Attendance is counted as "participation" and is required for success in the course.

Outside of the classroom sessions, students need to: coordinate with other students to work on assignments; and be ever vigilant looking for and responding to announcements from the professor.

- As scheduled, students are required to watch pre-recorded lectures ([via Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22fb3f01b4-21c5-4dff-86fb-ac85009bfd7f%22)) and to participate in real-time discussions (via Zoom)

- Pre-recorded lectures must be watched by students within 24 hours of publication

- Real-time discussions are conducted via Zoom and are recorded; if a student is unable to attend a discussion in real-time they must watch the recorded discussion (in Panopto) within 24 hours of publication

  *Students who neglect to watch the lecture videos on-time and/or neglect to participate in discussions or watched recorded discussions on-time, will loose points due to lack of participation, and they will be denied help when asked, and will receive neither flexibility with due dates nor a chance to get assignments re-graded*

## Texts and Materials

**No textbook:** this course does not use a textbook. All information required to pass the course comes from the recorded lectures so watching the lectures in Panopto and participating in the discussions is mandatory.  

### Personal Computer and Software

In addition to the hosted Web service, provided by the University, students will need to use a personal computer (PC or Mac) with specific capabilities and software installed:

- A code editor
- FTP software
- An updated, popular web browser
- A reliable Internet connection
- A local "web stack"

If a student does not have a personal computer with these capabilities, the University provides open labs at various locations on campus that they can use directly or through remote access.  Those computers have all the required capabilities and software installed and they are supported by University IT.  To access the University computers go to: [desktop.rochester.edu](https://desktop.rochester.edu)

For reference: during lectures the professor will be using a **Macbook** and **Windows PC** (alternatively) and a code editor: **Sublime Text, version 3** ([www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)). For FTP demonstrations, the professor will use **Cyberduck** (for Mac, [cyberduck.io](http://cyberduck.io)) and **WinSCP** (for PC, [winscp.net/eng/download.php](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)).  Demonstrations during the lecture and in labs will be done using **Google Chrome**.

The professor will introduce web server software that students can optionally install on their own computer.  The software can be installed using the free version of: MAMP (for both PC and Mac, [www.mamp.info/en](www.mamp.info/en))

## Lab Assignments and Projects

**Assignments** are made available via *the Course Documentation website* (where you're reading this syllabus) at the same time when most lectures are published online, and can be completed independently on one's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).  

**Note:** throughout the semester, the assignments build on each other, meaning: students cannot complete one assignment without successfully finishing the previous.  So, success in this course requires students to turn-in assignments on-time and in the right order.

**How to get help...**

While working on a lab or project assignment, students may need to ask questions answered and get extra instruction.  During a regular in-person semester, students would attend scheduled lab sections on campus where they could ask TAs for help.  In an online environment, we use our class web server and Slack.

*When technical help is needed...*

1. The student will FTP (upload) their files to their account on the Web

2. The student will check what they've uploaded to the server in a web browser and copy the URL

3. The student will go to the [#help channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T01JCCY00TV/C01K228NXLG) and create a post to ask a SPECIFIC question, and paste the URL

...the Professor will *start a thread* on the student's post to answer the question

### Assignment Due Dates

For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown near the top of the instructions. To avoid a zero grade, students must turn-in assignments via Blackboard on or before their due date.  

Due to the online/asynchronous nature of the course, there is no specific *time* related to the due date.  (Disregard the due "time" seen in Blackboard.) Students simply need to turn-in the assignments **within 24 hours** of the due date regardless of the time zone where they are located.

### Assignment Grading

Within about 24-48 hours of turning-in an assignment in Blackboard, the professor will provide a grade ONE TIME only, and only if the assignment was submitted in Blackboard **on or before its due date**.  

Assignments turned-in after the due date will get a zero unless a prior arrangement has been made with the professor.  See below...

### Late assignments

<u>Late assignments will not be graded</u> unless *a prior arrangement* has been made with the professor to get an extension by one or two days.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the professor. 

The grade for assignments not turned-in on time with no prior arrangement for an extension will be zero.

## Academic Honesty

Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003, published online December 2019](http://wpacouncil.org/aws/CWPA/pt/sd/news_article/272555/_PARENT/layout_details/false)). More specifically for DMS 290, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices

In the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of *inspiration*.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  Students must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as their own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.  For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)

## Academic Assistance and Accommodations

Please know that this classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. Students are invited to talk with the professor about any concern or situation that affects their ability to complete their academic work successfully. Useful resources for all students include the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, located at **1-154 Dewey Hall** on the River Campus; telephone: **(585) 275-9049** or email <cetl@rochester.edu>
