# Project 2: Principles of Page Design

*Checkpoint (halfway inspection), due: Friday, March 26, 2021*

*Final submission, due: Friday, April 2, 2021*

**The goal** of this project is to work as a team to apply the principles of page design to an existing website, and then publish it.

**The purpose** of this assignment is to demonstrate everything we've covered so far in DMS 290:

- Team collaboration using GitHub and Slack, and deployment using FTP
- Website construction using an Information Architecture
- Page design principles: CRAP principles; Layout; Typography

## Step 1: Join a Team

The focus of Project 2 is on **Visual Design**.  Whoever take the role of Visual Designer will, in effect, be the leader and need to coordinate with the team members to get the job done.  But be aware: *everyone* will have work to do on the visual properties of the website and will be graded accordingly AS INDIVIDUALS for their contributions.

- **Everyone:** go to [our shared **DMS 290 City-Teams** Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) and **copy** (not move) your name from "Project 1" to a *new* city-team and choose a new role for yourself
  - Leave the city names (row 15) as-is: "tbd" (stands for "to be determined")
  - Note: it's suggested to take-on a new role compared to Project 1 and work with new people; you'll get more out of DMS 290 if you do, but it isn't required
- **Technician:** create a new *private* channel in Slack, and then invite the other members
  - Note: you'll need a temporary name for your private channel; you'll have a permanent city-name later in the process and you can change your private channel's name at that time
  - Also note: you don't need to create a repository in GitHub yet. That comes later...

## Step 2: Choose a Project 1 Website

- **Everyone:** referring to [our shared **DMS 290 City-Teams** Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0), you'll need to decide among your team members which Project 1 website you'd like to FORK as a basis for your Project 2
  - Good candidates are projects on which you believe you can **IMPROVE the visual design** based on the principles of page design we learned over the past three weeks
  - It's okay to pick a website on which you worked before
  - IMPORTANT: each Project 1 website can be selected by only one team - so it's **first-come, first-serve**!
  - **Follow the instructions below** to see how to "squat" on a Project 1 website and claim it for your team...

*When evaluating candidates, be sure to consider:*

- Look at the existing information architecture

  - The **Information Architect** will be required to maintain a good IA in Project 2
  - If the information architecture is lacking in any way, the Information Architect in your team will need to fix it (or lose points of their grade for it)

- Look at the existing HTML

  - Although the **Technician** in your team won't be graded against the standards of CSC 170 (bullet proof websites), technical problems in the implementation (broken links, etc.) that is caused by incorrect code or mistakes when hosting the website will cost the Technician points off their grade
  - You'll notice that well-built, *bullet proof* HTML is easier to work with compared to messy code and inline styles
  - Also, if you're comfortable working with *PHP Includes*, that'll help the Technician avoid problems that might cost them points

- Do not pick a website based on aesthetic values because prettiness is *not* graded

  - The **Visual Designer** will be graded based on the implementation of the principles of page design

  - The Designer, working with their team will be accountable for:

    - Implementation of the CRAP principles throughout the website
    - Conversion of each webpage into an F-pattern layout
    - Creation of a new index (homepage) that uses a Z-pattern layout
    - Good use of typography to make the entire website more legible and readable, using the installation of custom fonts

    ...so find a Project 1 that looks like you can make significant improvements because *that's* how you'll be graded!

*When your team is ready to make a Project 1 selection:*

- The Project 1 website information must *not* be RED - which would indicate another team has already selected it
- Change your team's name (row 15) from "tbd" to the city-name of whichever Project 1 website you're selecting
- Change the *background color* of the Project 1 team information (rows 8-13) to RED to indicate to other teams that that Project 1 has been selected and no one else can choose it

## Step 3: Setup Your Project 2 Files

- **Technician:** change the name of your private Slack channel to the name of your new city-team.
- **Technician:** using the links in [our shared **DMS 290 City-Teams** Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0), create a new *public* repository in GitHub for Project 2 by FORKing your team's chosen Project 1 repository
  - Add the other members as collaborators to the new repo
  - Make sure everyone on your team is setup and sync'd with the repo on GitHub to their own computers
  - Add a link to the new GitHub repository in Row 19 of [our shared **DMS 290 City-Teams** Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) 

## Step 4: Create a Plan for an Improved Visual Design

*This is the bulk and focus of Project 2.  Everyone in the team will be graded individually for their contributions toward this part of the assignment.*

### Requirements

The new Project 2 website will need to fulfill the following requirements:

- Each city-page must be re-flowed into a F-pattern
- A new index (homepage) must be created and follow a Z-pattern
- The entire website (five pages) will need to be made-over with specific improvements to demonstrate your understanding of:
  - The CRAP principles
  - Legibility and Readability, including the installation of two new, appropriate custom web fonts

- IMPORTANT! **Visual Designer:** you will need to create a written plan for your team and submit it in Blackboard, by **Friday, March 26**

  - The following is the Visual Designer's responsibility but (suggestion) work closely with the team on this!  Leverage everyone's talents and suggestions; get their input on everything

  - Sketch wireframes of the new homepage and an example sub-page (city) using any tools you want to communicate your intent of the new layouts

    - Suggestion: scratch it out on paper, take pictures and share the image files with the team

  - Assign (or everyone pick) who works on what:

    - Coding the new layouts

    - Implementing the CRAP principles

    - Implementing the new, appropriate custom web fonts

      ...or however you want to divide-up the work among the team members

*Remember: whoever does what must be recorded and reported, so keep track of everything!*

## Step 5: Half-way Report

*Checkpoint (halfway inspection), due: Friday, March 26, 2021*

On behalf of the team, someone (typically the **Visual Designer**) needs to submit the report in Blackboard, about the plan to build the Project 2 website

The report becomes, in effect a contract of what the city-team plans to deliver; the final website delivered on Friday, April 2 will be graded against whatever is written in the report

The filetype of the report can be anything you want, typically Microsoft Word, PDF, Google Document

Everyone on the team will get the same grade (unless concerns are reported privately)

The report must include:

- Typical report formatting: heading, date, names and roles of everyone on the team, etc., and good grammar and no spelling mistakes
- A link to the existing Project 1 website that the team plans to improve
- A link to the new GitHub repository where the team plans to build the new, improved website
  - BTW, at this point in the two-week project, it'd be expected that *some* development work is already underway and visible in the repository, but not required at this point
- Images of wireframes that depict...
  - The planned, new homepage of the website that follows a Z-pattern layout
  - The planned subpages that follows an F-pattern layout (one wireframe that represents all four pages will do) 
  - OPTIONAL: other sketches/mock-ups of other planned improvements in the website's page layout principles - improvements that indicate use of the CRAP principles and better use of typography
- Descriptions of each planned area of improvement INCLUDING the name of the team member working on that part
  - NOTE: everyone's final grade for Project 2 will be based on the parts of the website on which they worked! So make sure everyone has enough to do
  - SUGGESTED: create a bulleted list of items that refer to specific areas of the existing website
  - REQUIRED: use the correct technical terms to describe the deficiencies and what is being done to improve them
- List two NEW well-paired fonts that will be used in the new website and...
  - Describe why those fonts were chosen and why they improve the website
  - HINT: use technical terms to describe how the fonts better match the *mood and feeling* of the content, and *never* say anything like, "they look better"

NOTE: the **due date of the REPORT, submitted in Blackboard is Friday, March 26**

- Failure to obtain a passing grade for the report will result in a zero for every member of the team, for the overall Project
- The final Project 2 website, delivered by Friday, April 2, 2021 will be graded against the half-way report

- The professor will provide feedback on the half-way report as soon as possible; if the feedback suggests changes to the plan, the suggestions *must* be incorporated into the final Project 2 website when it's delivered on Friday, April 2

## Step 6: Deploy the Website

- The **Technician** is required to make sure all the code (HTML, CSS, and optionally PHP and/or JavaScript) is coded correctly, works correctly and meets *most* industry standards and best practices *within reason*
  - Although the professor will check both the HTML and CSS against the W3C validators, only really, *really* sloppy code with mistakes that cause the website to not render correctly will lose points; other than that, the bar is (still) very low in DMS 290 from a technical standpoint

- **Technician**: install the website on UR Digital Scholar in a folder named **project02**

## Step 7: EVERYONE - Turn-in the Project for Credit

NOTE: just like with Project 1, **everyone** needs to create a submission in Blackboard

- **Everyone:** in Blackboard, in the **Assignments/Projects Turn-in** area, in **Project 2: Principles of Page Design**, write in the **Write Submission** area (*not* the comments box):
  - **Your city-team name**
  - A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own) and the **role everyone performed** in this project: IA, Designer; or Technician
  - A **link to your team's website** on the class web server
  - A **link to your team's repository** (which should be set to public)

*Optional: since everyone is reporting in Blackboard individually, in your submission in Blackboard, you can report any concerns you had about the development work, how things turned-out, or everyone's contribution to the project; whatever you write will be private and the professor won't take any action on it without discussing it with you first*
