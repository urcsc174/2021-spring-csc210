# Project 4: Customized Website with a CSS Framework

*Part 0 "Setup" due: Wednesday, April 28*

*Part 1 "Project Plan" due: Friday, April 30*

*Part 2 "Website" due: Friday, May 7 (last day of classes*)

**The goal** of this project is to work as a two-person team to create and publish a new website, with architected content and a look & feel that uses all the principles of visual design, and then host it on your own UR Digital Scholar account.

**The purpose** of this assignment is to demonstrate everything we've learned in DMS 290 so far (except using a CMS).

## Part 0: Setup

*Part 0 due: Wednesday, April 28*

NOTE: points will be deducted from your final grade for Project 4 if this step is not done before the due date (Wednesday)

### Step 1: Join a Team

The focus of Project 4 is evenly distributed among all TWO roles: Information Architect; and Visual Designer.  Both team members will need to figure out an equitable division of the responsibilities typically done by the technician role.

- **Everyone:** go to [our shared **DMS 290 City-Teams** Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) and enter your name in the **Project 4** table
  - Notice that there are teams of two now; you pick either **Information Architect** or **Visual Designer**
  - For this project it doesn't matter what city you pick; actually, you can change the city names if you want
  - Suggestion: if you are comfortable using *PHP Includes* then indicate so in the table by setting your background color to yellow.  If both you and your teammate can use *Includes* that'll help in the development process.
  - The responsibilities of **Technician** need to be split between the two team members, however you want - just try to divide the tasks equitably
- **Technician:** (anyone) create a new *private* channel in Slack, and then invite the other member
- **Technician:** create a new *public* repository in GitHub for Project 4 
  - Add the other member as collaborators to the new repo
  - Make sure the team is setup and sync'd with the repo on GitHub
  - Add a link to the new GitHub repository in **row 38** of [our shared **DMS 290 City-Teams** Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hWZWyvZobvzQhYiwNjiSP8E1cHAMDaDE1f0p8tx7zs/edit#gid=0) 

## Part 1: Project Plan

*Part 1 due: Friday, April 30*

### Step 1: Create an Information Architecture in HTML

- **Information Architect:** pick a new topic - any topic - around which you'll build the Project 4 website architecture
  - You may not use "cities" or anything like that because we've already done that
  - Suggestion: decide together, with the Visual Designer
  - Suggestion: think about a topic that (#1) you like - because you need to be familiar with it; and (#2) that lends itself to structured data, i.e. a topic with repeatable "*classes*" for example
    - Good topic: Soccer Team<u>s</u> (plural)
    - Bad topic: A particular soccer team<br>...unless you want to focus on the players, in which case you can build your *classes* around the team member<u>s</u> (plural)

- **Information Architect:** create a plain text document named **project04-architecture.md**
  - Format the document as you write, creating logical headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. 
    - Remember: you'll be graded on all the usual expectations for a college-level document

  - In the Markdown document, define the **Ontology**, **Taxonomy**, and **Choreography**
    - Refer to the [detailed instructions in Assignment 4](https://docs.csc174.org/assign04-ia-definition/instructions.html#step-2-define-an-information-architecture) to remind yourself how that works
- **Information Architect:** in Blackboard, upload the **project04-architecture.md** file into the **Project 4: Project Plan** assignment 
  - In the *Write Submission* area, write "Information Architect" (so I know which rubric to use) 

### Step 2: Create a Plan for the Visual Design

- **Visual Designer:** based on the topic that you and the Information Architect decide upon, you can make design decisions - even before you have content to work with
  - Remember:  you can use placeholder text (lorem ipsum) and FPO (for position only) images to communicate the design
  - Also remember: you *cannot* arbitrarily make design choices!  You need to reflect the *mood and purpose* of the content in the design, and document the choices you make

- **Visual Designer:** create a plain text document named **project04-design.md**

  - Format the document as you write, creating logical headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. 

    - Remember: you'll be graded on all the usual expectations for a college-level document

  - In the document, describe (in words) your intent for the design of the website in terms of:

    - Layout(s)
    - Color pallet
    - Typography

    ...if you're able (if you have the skill), embed images that represent your choices (e.g. font samples, color swatches, etc.)

    ...if you're not able to embed images, submit them separately when you turn-in this part of the project in Blackboard

  - Suggestion: your illustrations can contain any combination of wireframe diagrams, sketches, or [detailed "comps" (Wikipedia definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_layout)
  - Required: design choices must be documented (described), explaining the rationale for your choices; refer to the [numerous previous assignments and projects](https://docs.csc174.org/schedule.html) for details of how to document your design choices
    - Remember: you have to document WHY you chose what you did, and never say anything like "I liked the way it looks"
  - NOTE: for this project, there is no prescribed set of layouts you need to fulfill, i.e. Z-pattern, F-pattern, whatever ...it's totally up to you.  However, whatever you choose must be appropriate for the content that ends-up presented in the website!

- **Visual Designer** in Blackboard, upload the **project04-design.md** file into the **Project 4: Project Plan** assignment 

  - In the *Write Submission* area, write "Visual Designer" (so I know which rubric to use)
